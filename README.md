# Pokemon Go Ban Check

#### CAUTION: Use of this program or anything else third party that uses the unofficial API is a risk for you getting banned. You have been warned.

Pokemon Go Ban Check (such an original name) is a program to help you determine with ease if your Pokemon Go account is banned. It requires .Net Framework 4.6.1 to run.

The ban wave has affected many players, legit and non legit accounts have been banned. The program works that when you try to login if you have not been banned status_code:2 will be retrieved, but status_code:3 will be retrieved if you have been banned. For right now, it is still unknown why people are getting banned, so every program that uses unofficial API is risky and has a chance to get you banned.
